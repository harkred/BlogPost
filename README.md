## BlogPost
‚≠ê *Just a simple blogpost project.* ‚≠ê
###### We used [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for GUI and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as our local relational database. <br /> You can also use other cloud based and local databases like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) by making necessary changes in the program.

*To run this project just run **[main.py](https://github.com/harkred/BlogPost/blob/master/main.py)**.*
