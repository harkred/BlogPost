## BlogPost
‚≠ê Just a simple blog project.
<br /><br />
We used [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as our local relational database. You can also use cloud based and local databases like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) by making necessary changes in the program.
<br />
To run this project just run [main.py](https://github.com/harkred/BlogPost/blob/master/main.py).
